## Description

We depends heavily on Images these days, and sometimes developers need to make processing on these files and one of these things that give us headache is backgorund removal, I really hate that there are so few open source background removal models and libraries so I decided to make this library open source so people can use it, If this suits your need, give it a try ðŸ˜‰

`Background removal` can give you two different outouts

- Mask Image: The mask for your input image (black & white) so you can do any processing that you needs
- Output image: ( default case) your output image without its background 

And, it has zero dependencies ðŸ˜Ž

## Usage

### Output image

To start the background removal on your image you just need to pass a `UIImage` component to the library and get your output image, only that 

```swift
let image = UIImage(named: "child")
outputImage.image = BackgroundRemoval.init().removeBackground(image: image!)
```

The output will always be a `UIImage` in all cases.

### Mask Image

In case you wanted only The mask for your input image (black & white), then you case pass `maskOnly` arg to the library

```swift
let image = UIImage(named: "child")
segmentedImage.image = BackgroundRemoval.init().removeBackground(image: image!, maskOnly: true)
```

### iOS version

The model supports macOS = 11, iOS = 14. however the library currently supports only iOS systems.
